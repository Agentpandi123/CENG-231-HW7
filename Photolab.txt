PhotoLab:
I just changed the DIPs to work with Image and with the new Image.c file.

Image:
I set the pointers in each of the functions for GetPixel and SetPixel.
I then did a delete image to unassign the pointers for the image file.
I then  made the create image which assigned pointers to each of the RGB values and the Width and Height
All of the photos work and turn out the same as Assignment 6, even crop works, but I can't figure out how to fix the memory leaks or what the cause of it was.  Excluding the memory leaks, everything works fine.
